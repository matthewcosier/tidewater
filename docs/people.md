# People: the townsfolk brain

Wave 4.1, step 1 of 5. People notice you and react: heads turn, they wave or nod, and now and then they say something in a speech bubble. Later lanes add bumps and falls, the busy beach, E to chat, and life moments.

## Files

| File | What it holds |
| --- | --- |
| `src/people/People.js` | The hub, `app.people`. The registry, the grid and bus, the smart objects, the bubbles, detail by distance, event polling, the CPU meter, `state()`. |
| `src/people/Brain.js` | One brain per person. Archetypes, moods, memory of the player, the utility decider, `REACT` (how each event is taken). |
| `src/people/Perception.js` | `Grid` (spatial hash, 8 m cells) and `Bus` (events to everyone in range, plus subscribers). |
| `src/people/SmartObjects.js` | `ACTIVITIES` (the activity table), `SmartObject` (slots, neighbours) and `SmartObjects` (claim, release, mateOf). |
| `src/people/Speech.js` | The DOM bubbles. They use `.tw-glass` and the ui.css tokens. |
| `src/people/Lines.js` | The lines table, by context and archetype. |
| `src/people/Pose.js` | Head look (yaw down the spine, neck and head; pitch at the neck and head) and the seated tuck (knees aside, chest leaning away). It runs on top of the clip. |
| `src/people/Contact.js` | Bumps (`app.people.contact`): the player's walker and the rally car against people, the knock timelines (nudge, stagger, tumble, fall, flinch, jump, dive), overboard and the swimmer, held things and fetching them. |
| `src/people/Tumble.js` | A townsperson's ragdoll: the player's `Ragdoll.js` on the crowd rig (player.glb's capsules scaled by the idle's pelvis height, getup_back / getup_belly / tread / swim retargeted by bone name), at most `MAX` (2) at once, SUB 3. |
| `src/people/Props.js` | Things people carry in the left hand (coffee, phone, book, esky, bag, rod, chips), the drop arc and bounce, a coffee stain. |
| `src/ferry/Crowd.js` | The ferry crowd, the first owner. It keeps its bodies, routes, queues, boarding, drivers and `holding()`. |

## How it fits

The owner (Crowd.js) moves bodies and plays clips. The brain decides and never touches the body. Each frame the owner keeps these fields on each person: `world`, `yaw`, `posture` (`sit`, `stand` or `walk`), `head` (eye height) and `can( clipKey )`. It reads these from the brain:

- `target` and `lookUntil`: where the head looks. This is a live Vector3: the player's head, the bird, a neighbour's head, the horn.
- `engagedUntil`: a standing person turns their body to the target too.
- `gesture`: `{ clip, greet }`, a one-shot clip key. The owner plays it and clears it. Seated people never get a standing gesture.
- `activity`: `{ name, clip, pitch }`, the looping clip key, plus a head bow for phone, book and doze.
- `tuck` and `away`: seated, knees swung aside, away from the player.

`App.js` creates the hub before the ferry and calls `people.update( dt )` after the cockatoo.

## The brain

- **Archetypes** (`ARCHETYPES`): friendly, grumpy, shy, larrikin, kid, elderly. Their traits are warmth, chat, bold, patience, energy, curiosity, humour and wave. `weight` sets how common each one is. Kids have weight 0 until there are child avatars (the beach lane).
- **Moods**: energy, sociability, curiosity, patience and annoyance. They start from the traits plus some noise. Energy runs down and dozing restores it. Annoyance decays faster in patient people.
- **Memory of the player**: `friendly` (you stayed for their chat), `ignored` (they spoke and you walked straight off), `annoyed` (squeezing past an impatient person, or twice within a minute), `bumped` (hook: `brain.bump( t, strength )`). Two ignores and they stop talking to you. A friendly memory makes them greet you with `greet-again`.
- **Thinking**: the hub runs `think()` at 2 to 5 Hz within 25 m, with staggered times. Each think does three things. First it senses the player directly: close by and looking at them, or squeezing past their seat. Then it takes the most telling event from its inbox (salience × curiosity, plus noise; a dozer cares less). Finally, when the activity's hold runs out, it re-chooses. The decider scores every activity the slot offers, adds noise and a small penalty for repeating, and takes the best one.
- **Greeting** (kept from the old Crowd.js behaviour, which `test/browser/crowd.spec.js` checks): the first time they are close and looked at, a standing person waves or nods, and maybe says a line. If you stay (2.5 s, or 4 s for the shy), they talk with their hands or point. Then there is a 15 s cool-down, and 8 s after you leave.

## Events

`app.people.bus.emit( type, at, radius, data )` delivers an event to everyone within `radius`, scaled by their hearing (elderly 0.7). People beyond 80 m get nothing. `bus.on( type | '*', fn )` sees every event.

| Event | Source (polled at 5 Hz in `People.sense`) | Radius |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `horn` | `ferry.horns` changes. The source is 14 m up her mast. | 600 m |
| `bird-near`, `bird-landed` | The cockatoo is `flying` or `resting`. Under a roof he stays on the shoulder (Cockatoo.js), so nothing is sent. | 7 m |
| `player-run` | The player's ground speed is over 4 m/s. Aboard it is measured in her frame. A move of a metre in one frame is a teleport, not a run. | 9 m |
| `jetski` | A ski in `app.jetskis.skis` doing over 4 m/s. | 30 m |
| `car` | The player's rally car doing over 8 km/h. | 8 m |

Some things are sensed directly, not sent on the bus: the player close and looking (3 m, and the camera within `SEEN` 0.8 of them), and the player within 1.9 m of a seated person (`People.close`, every frame). The squeeze line needs the player to be moving.

How each event is taken lives in `REACT` in Brain.js: salience, how long the head follows it, the line context, the base chance of speaking, standing gestures, and annoyance. A reaction holds their eye (`reactUntil`) even while you stand in front of them.

## Smart objects and activities

A `SmartObject` has a `kind`, a `tag` and `slots` (each with `mates`, the neighbouring slot indices). People `claim` a slot and `release` it when they leave. The brain chooses between the `ACTIVITIES` whose `at` includes the slot's kind.

| Kind | Where (Crowd.js) | Activities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `seat` | Her saloon: benches of two, 12 per side | sit, sitLook, phone, read, doze, yawn, sitChat (needs a neighbour) |
| `queue` | The gangway gate at each terminal: 12 spots in pairs | wait, lookAround, phoneCall, talk / listen / laugh / shrug (need a neighbour) |
| `rail` | Her sun deck rail, per side | lookOut, wait, lookAround, phoneCall, and the chat set with the next place along |
| `spot` | Hook: standing chat spots (the beach lane) | the standing set |

Chats need turn-taking: `talk` scores low when the mate is talking, and `listen` scores high. People in a chat look at their mate's head.

**Adding an activity**: add a row to `ACTIVITIES` (`at`, `clip` key, `hold`, optional `pitch` and `mate`, and `score( brain, mate )`). If it needs a new clip, add its key to `CLIP` in the owner and to `STATIC` in `tools/characters/build_crowd.sh`. Rebuild, then run `crowd_keys.mjs`. Sitting clip keys also go in Crowd.js `SITTING`.

**Adding a smart object**: `app.people.objects.add( new SmartObject( { kind, tag, slots: [ { ...your data, mates: [ ... ] } ] } ) )`. Claim with `objects.claim( kind, filter, person )`. The owner keeps the positions; the object only knows its slots and who is in them.

## Lines and bubbles

`Lines.js` has these contexts: `greet`, `greet-again`, `chat`, `squeeze`, `squeeze-again`, `bird-shoulder`, `bird`, `horn`, `jetski`, `running`, `car`. Each context has lines per archetype, and `any` as the fallback. `line()` avoids the person's last four lines.

Keeping it rare:
- Per person: a line only when the reaction's dice allow it, then a cool-down of 14 to 28 s × (1.4 − chat).
- Global: at most 2 bubbles on screen, a 2.2 s gap between any two, and only people within 24 m of the camera.
- A bubble stays 2.4 s plus 45 ms per character, then fades out over 220 ms.

## Detail by distance

The hub sets `p.lod` from the camera distance:

| Band | Brain | Animation (owner) | Events |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| near, under 25 m | 2 to 5 Hz, staggered | every frame (every other frame when still; a third of the frames if behind the camera) | yes |
| mid, 25 to 80 m | 1 Hz | every third frame | yes |
| far, over 80 m | none (inbox cleared) | frozen; hidden past 90 m | no |

`app.people.state().cpu` gives `ms` (the average per frame: the hub plus what owners `charge()`, which for Crowd.update means routes, animation and pose), `peak` (the last 2 s) and `hub` (the hub alone).

## Bumps (step 2)

- **Bodies**: `Player.update` calls `app.people.contact.player( player, dt, deck )` after the walker moves (walk mode, and her decks through FerryDeck, where `deck.local` is pushed too). The walker is pushed out of each person's capsule (0.3 + 0.27 m; seated, 0.28 m round their knees). The player's own boat deck (`deck` mode) is not wired: nobody boards it, and it keeps its own deck-local position.
- **Grades** (approach speed, measured in her frame aboard; bumps round 2026-09-27): under 1 m/s a nudge (sidestep, turn, "oh, sorry"); from 1 m/s a shove, the `stagger` (a 1D knock along the normal, player 75 kg against 72, a kid 35, restitution 0.2: they carry `vOut` off and stop it at 2.6 m/s2 over one or two steps back, 0.25 to 1.3 m, arms out, the upper body rocking, Pose.js `stepL` / `stepR`; your walker keeps only `vKeep` along the normal, so you stop against them); from 4 m/s on open ground a `tumble`, a real ragdoll (Tumble.js) launched by the knock, then the keyed get-up, a laugh, a glare or a shrug and a `getup` line, and the fetch of whatever flew. Elderly go down only from a jog, 3.6 m/s (-0.4; a walk into them is a stagger, bumps round 2 2026-09-27), shy sooner (-0.3), larrikins later (+0.6). A kid knocked hard gets the old sit-down `fall`, never a ragdoll; past `MAX` ragdolls it is the `fall` too. Seated people flinch when you run past within 1.75 m (the benches keep you off their knees).
- **Overboard** (the owner's scope change, 2026-09-27): a tumble on narrow footing where a step or two along the push is off their footing (`canStand` says no) and the sea is under it (her rail, a pier's edge) sends an adult over as a ragdoll with the deck's own velocity (a splash: `contact.splash` throws droplets, spray and mist on the island's `app.spray` and plays `app.audio.splash`, the big splash sample), then `k.sw`: tread water with a `dunked` line ("Oi!", "Ya drongo!", "Cold!"), swim at 1 m/s for the nearest dry land or low ramp (`groundAt( x, z, SEA + 0.6 )`, 24 bearings, 120 m), wade from 1.1 m deep, an `ashore` line and a glare or a shrug, then home: on foot when the way is dry land, else (her deck) once out of the camera's sight. Kids never go over. At most `WET` (2) in the sea at once.
- **Swimmer hook** (lifebuoy, liferaft; next lane): `contact.swimmers()` lists `{ p, at, target, state }` (`tread`, `swim`, `wade`, `out`); `contact.rescue( p, target )` sends one to a world point, where they tread water (`waiting`) until sent on again.
- **Footing** (`p.footing()` from the owner): `narrow` (the gate queue, over the gangway, her rail) turns a fall or a tumble into a stagger unless it is overboard. Every step of a knock goes through the owner's `p.canStand( w, base )` (the sand: the same floor; the pier, the terminal and the hire stand: `contact.boards( w, base )`, a walkable plank within 0.35 m of theirs and no solid box across the way at knee height, so a shove moves them along the planks and stops them short of a rail, a bench or crates; aboard, never past her rail). Before round 2 the pier's fishers refused every step (0 of 8), so a shove there moved them 0 m.
- **A fall**: the sit clip lowered 0.42 m with the knees up (Pose.js knock layer), up through `crouch_idle` and `crouch_out`, then a glare (`idle_angry_01`) if they keep away, a laugh if they are funny, else a shrug, and a `getup` or `spill` line. What they held flies off (Props.js) and they walk over, crouch and pick it up. Walkers wait rather than walk through someone on the ground.
- **Memory**: `brain.bump( t, strength, event, at )` counts real bumps in `memory.bumped` and raises annoyance. The cooler sorts (warmth under 0.6) get `keepAway`: they step back from you within 2.4 m and greet you with `wary`.
- **Cars**: every frame the rally car (driving or coasting) is checked against people near its line. Under 20 km/h they jump back, or fall if it is already on them; faster, an early dive from its speed and heading (1.3 s warning). Anyone still inside its footprint is put outside it at once. A line (`oi`), then `oi-after`.
- **Clips**: the crowd build adds `idle_angry_01`, `crouch_idle`, and `crouch_in` / `crouch_out` (men only in Rocketbox; the women blend to the crouch).
- **Bubbles**: a bump's line is urgent (past the cool-down, the gap and the two-on-screen cap). A bubble rides the owner's `head` point and stays in the frame under the HUD row for someone right in front of you.

## Hooks for the next lanes

- **After a bump**: a shy or elderly person sitting on a nearby bench after a fall needs bench smart objects ashore (the beach lane). NPC against NPC bumps, and props for the props physics, are not done.
- **Beach population**: a new owner registers people with `app.people.add( p, { archetype } )`, keeps `world`, `yaw`, `posture` and `head` current, and adds `spot` and bench smart objects. Kids need child avatars and `weight` > 0.
- **E to chat**: the brain's memory (`friendly`, `ignored`, `annoyed`) and its mood give the opening line. Use the `chat` context and `bus.on`.
- **Life moments** (for example "oh no, I missed the ferry"): subscribe with `bus.on( 'horn', ... )` or read the ferry service's phase, set an activity or gesture, and `hub.say()` a new context.

## Forks and known gaps

- Drivers' `path` and `out` are still one array, as before, so a driver vanishes from their seat at the far berth instead of walking back down (Crowd.js `spawnDriver`). This is kept on purpose; fixing it changes the service's timing.
- Perception has no sight lines: a bird over the saloon roof is "near" people inside.

## The beach (step 3)

- **Owner**: `src/people/Beach.js` (`app.beach`), created in `App.js` after the hire stand and updated before `people.update`. 26 people: five camps (towels, sand, umbrellas, eskies), beach cricket (bowler, batter, keeper, fielder; the ball is scripted), a frisbee pair east of the pier, two shell hunters on the tideline, three swimmers treading water past 1.45 m, two waders, two fishers on the pier head (clothed, rods), and the hire attendant (clothed m04, stool, phone, clipboard).
- **Slot kinds**: `camp` (the slot's `kind` is towel, reader, phoner or sand; `sunbake`, `campRead`, `campPhone` score by it), `swim` (`tread`), `wade`, `line` (`fish`), `stool`, and `cricket` / `frisbee` / `shells` (`play`, the owner scripts the body).
- **Bodies**: `public/models/characters/crowd/swim/<cast>.glb` (`tools/characters/crowd_swim.py`, Blender python) where built, else the clothed crowd. Lying is the idle clip on a tilt group turned -90 degrees about x; sitting on the sand is the chair clip lowered 0.42 m with the knees up (Pose.js knock `legs`); treading is the idle clip 1.38 m down.
- **Detail**: still people (lying, sitting, the stool, treading) animate a third of the frames near and a sixth mid. Measured with 46 people (ferry crowd plus beach) on the beach: 0.64 to 0.69 ms average, 1.1 ms peak.
- **Occluder fade**: `ThirdPersonCamera.apply` calls `app.people.occlude( lens, head )`; people across that line fade to 0.85 on interleaved gradient noise shifted every frame (`frame.frameIndex`), which the TAA resolves into a smooth see-through; the old 4 x 4 Bayer read as a coarse checkerboard (`src/people/Fade.js`, every crowd and beach material is alpha-tested with a `fade` uniform). The boom no longer needs to pull in for people.
- **Jetski hire**: `HireDesk` in `src/world/JetskiHire.js` wraps `app.jetskis.offer` (Jetski.js untouched). Unpaid, at the counter or a beach ski, E is "Hire a jetski · $20" (`game.state.spend`); broke, a line and no charge. Paid: the safety line, he walks out and pushes, "Ride jetski" returns. Stepped off near the stand after a ride: he walks out, ties it up, the hire ends. `?freeHire` skips the fee.
- **Cocky on people**: `Beach.cocky()` rarely (8% a second while he explores near sunbakers or sitters) sets `cockatoo.spot` and calls `cockatoo.startLanding( 'spot' )`. The person laughs and takes a photo, shoos him, or (a larrikin) offers a chip. `app.forceCocky = true` forces it for checks.
- **Gotcha**: `SkinnedModel.play( name )` hands back the live layer when that clip is already current, even if it has ended, so a one-shot gesture replayed never ends again and a walker waiting for it stalls. Use `Beach.gest()` (restarts the layer and keeps a timer).

## The jetski hire stand and its attendant (Beach.js, src/world/JetskiHire.js)

- The stand (`tools/jetski/hire_build.py` -> `public/models/jetski-hire.glb`) is weathered timber: gapped boards in
  mixed greys and browns with rusty nail heads. Its counter is the east end (stand frame +x), facing the path down
  from the village, with a painted "JETSKI HIRE / $20 A RIDE" sign, a key board with keys on floats (one hook
  empty), a cash tin, a brochure stand, a leaflet and a clipboard. The top sign faces east and west (lettered both
  sides); the A-frame by the path says $20, the same as `HIRE_FEE`. Four life jackets (collar, foam blocks,
  three buckled straps, side straps, reflective tape, a hanger each) hang on a rail along the back; the back is
  open east of them, the attendant's way in and out. The dolly lies off the west end. The awning slopes down to
  the sea with the valance on its low edge.
- The attendant sits on a stool on the deck inside the east end (`Beach.layout`, `deckY()`), facing +x over the
  counter; the stand's solid collider keeps walkers off him. `HireDesk.counter` is the east side of the counter;
  `AROUND` takes him out the back and round the west end, so he never walks through a customer at the counter.
  `Beach.floor()` keeps walkers on the deck inside the stand's footprint.
- His body is `public/models/beach/attendant.glb` (`tools/beach/staff_shirt.py`): the swim crowd's m01 with the
  white tee dyed the hire's teal, the fold shading kept. Missing, the clothed m04 stands in.
- Worn props (`Beach.wear`, `WEAR`): sunnies, `sun_hat` and `bucket_hat` ride the `Bip01 Head` bone. The offset
  is solved once against the rest pose and carried by the head's matrix each animated frame; a faded person's
  hat is hidden. The crown sits 0.232 m (men) or 0.217 m (women) above the head bone's rest origin.
- The reader at the x = 29 camp has put her book down: the `book` GLB lies open on the sand beside her
  (`bookDown`), so she holds nothing.

## Beach round 3 notes

- Bodies: `Beach.plan()` runs once after `layout()` and promises each crowd slot a cast (three bodies a cast) that no slot within `NEIGHBOUR` (6 m) already has; `fill()` places a body only in a slot promised its cast, so the casts can load in any order without twins side by side. `fill( true )` after the last cast takes whatever is left, still preferring a body no neighbour wears.
- Speech bubbles fade in over 90 ms (readable at once) and out over 220 ms, with a soft text shadow for bright sand behind the glass.
- See-through people (Fade.js) verified in game: `people.occlude( a, b )` with a line through a standing person eases their fade to 0.85 in about 0.3 s and the dither shows. A prop held in the hand (the batter's bat) does not fade with its holder yet.

## Bubbles, sitters, fades and the tin (people-fix round)

- **Bubbles keep clear of the HUD** (Speech.js `place`). Every visible `.tw-glass` box (the minimap `gm-map`, the icon rail `tw-rail`, the purse `gm-purse`, the prompts and keys `tw-prompt`) is read from the DOM twice a second and on each new bubble; boxes over 30% of the screen (menus) are skipped. A bubble whose head sits under a panel is hidden; one that would overlap a panel moves the smallest way clear (left, right or up, 8 px gap, at most 150 px) and its tail (`--pp-tail`) still points at the head. The top pills are not `.tw-glass`: the `TOP` clamp (110 px) keeps bubbles under them.
- **Sand sitters sit on the sand** (Beach.js `seat`). The chair-sit clips hold the pelvis at chair height, and a fixed 0.42 m drop left the casts with higher hips (the women, about 0.19 m pelvis bone to sand) sitting on air. The drop now puts the pelvis bone `SAND.seat` (0.15 m) above the floor sampled under the pelvis itself, from last frame's pose; mid-blend or with no pelvis bone the fixed drop stands. Clamped to 0.3 to 0.6 m.
- **What people wear or hold fades with them** (Fade.js `setGroupFade`, `fadeCustomize`). The hats, sunnies and bat load with the fade uniform (Beach.js `FADES`), the hand props (Props.js) build with it, and People.js fades `p.item`, `p.bat` and `p.wear` in its fade loop. The first fade gives each mesh its own material copy (the sources are shared); a part without the uniform (a stand-in) hides past 0.3 instead. Worn things are no longer hidden outright.
- **Occluders against a high chase camera** (People.js `occlude`). The test now takes the band between the sight lines to the player's head and to their chest (0.8 m lower), so someone hiding the player's body fades even when the lens looks down past their head. Proved through the real third-person camera: the batter between lens and player fades to 0.85, bat included.
- **The cash tin's key ring** (tools/jetski/hire_build.py `torus`) is one smooth torus (24 x 10, 9.5 mm, 1.4 mm wire). A chain of 4-sided tube segments broke into dashes at that size. The build also rewrites public/models/jetski-buoys.glb (not byte-stable); restore it when only the stand changed.
