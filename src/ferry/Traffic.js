// Other people's cars on the ferry service. At each terminal a queue waits in the marshalling
// lanes (topped up by cars driving in from beyond the boom gate); once her ramp is down at that
// berth the cars that crossed with her drive off first (aft down their lanes, down the ramp, over
// the linkspan and out past the gate, where they go), then the queue drives aboard nose to tail:
// over the linkspan and up her ramp at walking pace, up her centre lane, round at the bow and aft
// down the outer lanes to park facing the stern, ready to drive off at the far side. No car parks
// in her centre lanes; they only drive up them, because both outer lanes fill from the stern and
// the centre is the one lane with no parked car in it. Scripted: each car stops and waits for any
// car ahead of it in the order and gives way to the player's car (app.rally): it stops and waits
// whenever that car's footprint, now or where its velocity takes it over the next LOOK s, comes
// within CLEAR of the road this car is about to drive (playerInWay), and no car starts aboard
// while the player's car is moving through the lanes, over the linkspan or on her deck (SETTLE).
// The timetable holds
// her ramp down until the cars that started are clear (holding()). A boarding car held up by the
// player's car for STUCK seconds gives way: if it has turned at her bow it parks where it stands,
// otherwise it backs out to its place in the queue, with every car boarding behind it, and no
// more cars start aboard at that call (so a player parked in the way never keeps her at the berth).
// Solid: each car near the player's has two kinematic bodies in the car physics (solid()), so the
// player's car stops against it. Aboard, a car's pose is kept in her frame, so it rides with her.
