// Rigid-body personal watercraft (a 3.3 m, 350 kg performance stand-up / sit-down ski plus its
// rider), six degrees of freedom, fixed 120 Hz substeps. See docs/jetski.md for the model and tuning.
//
//  * Hydrostatics: one water column per hull sample (bottom panel -> deck), the water height from
//    the GPU queries, extrapolated with the water's vertical velocity over the read-back latency and
//    asked for where the sample will be by then (speed lead), as in BoatController. Columns work
//    upside down too (a capsized ski floats on its deck).
//  * Planing: every wetted bottom panel is a lifting surface: p = 1/2 rho C |v| (v . n), along its
//    own normal (deadrise and rocker), so lift, induced drag, lateral chine grip and porpoising damping
//    all come from the same term; an extra Wagner-style slam term on panels entering the water.
//  * Drag: skin friction on the wetted panels, the displacement hump (15-25 km/h), strake cross-flow
//    with a grip stall past ~20 deg of slip (the slide), burying drag when the bow digs in, air drag.
//  * Jet: engine spool (0.4 s), idle creep, momentum thrust rho A Vj (Vj - u) from the nozzle, only
//    while the intake is wet (it over-revs in the air); the nozzle vectors the thrust, so there is no
//    steering without thrust; a reverse bucket for braking and slow astern.
//  * Rider: 85 kg on the seat; his lean moves the centre of gravity (fore / aft, into the turn) and he
//    holds the bank with his body (a bounded roll torque); in the air he can pitch and roll the ski.
//  * Crashes: rolling past ~100 deg, a nose-dive landing or a violent slam throws him off; the lanyard
//    cuts the engine.
